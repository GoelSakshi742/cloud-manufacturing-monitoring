# Cloud‑Enabled Manufacturing Monitoring System
*(Simulated Telemetry & Real‑Time Metrics)*

## Overview

This project is a **cloud‑ready backend system** that simulates industrial machine telemetry and computes **real‑time and historical uptime/downtime metrics** on demand.

It is designed using **enterprise backend patterns** commonly found in manufacturing, oil & gas, and industrial IoT systems.

The system does **not integrate with real hardware**, but it is structured as if it could, making it suitable for demonstrating **professional backend engineering skills**.

## Key Features

- ✅ Simulated machine telemetry (Running / Stopped)
- ✅ Event‑driven, time‑series data modeling
- ✅ Dynamic uptime & downtime calculation (no pre‑aggregation)
- ✅ Rolling time windows (e.g., last 30 / 60 minutes)
- ✅ Current downtime streak tracking
- ✅ Clean layered architecture
- ✅ REST API with Swagger
- ✅ Unit‑tested business logic

---

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a **clean, layered architecture** to ensure separation of concerns and future scalability.
